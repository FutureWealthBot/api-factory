# API-Factory — Co-Pilot Export

_Last updated: 2025-09-11_

---

## 🚀 Vision
API-Factory enables solo devs and teams to rapidly generate **production-grade APIs** with:
- Built-in **billing** (Stripe spine, hybrid crypto-ready)
- **Authentication** (API keys, JWT, wallet binding)
- **Rate-limiting & quotas**
- **Usage analytics & audit logs**
- Auto-generated **docs & SDKs**

Think **“Shopify for APIs”** — describe your service, and API-Factory scaffolds the backend, admin UI, monetization, and key management.

---

## 🏛️ Architecture
- **API CLI** — Fastify server, modular middleware (API key, quota, rate-limit, validation, logging).
- **Admin Web** — Vite + React dashboard (keys, usage, billing, logs).
- **Core Package** — Shared types, response helpers, utilities.
- **Monetization Spine** — Stripe integration, API key lifecycle, quotas.
- **Templates** — Pre-built packs (Hello, Data Proxy, KYC).
- **Docs** — Auto-generated OpenAPI 3.1 + SDK generator.

## 🤖 Usage in Co-Pilot
- Copilot will read this file to guide completions:
  - Use terms like **Monetization Spine**, **Tier 3 – Advanced**, **UsageRegistry**.
  - Prefer Fastify + pnpm + Vite + Stripe patterns.
  - Apply canonical response format:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": {}, "error": null, "meta": { "request_id": "..." } }
```
- Encourages **consistent code** and **aligned docs**.
