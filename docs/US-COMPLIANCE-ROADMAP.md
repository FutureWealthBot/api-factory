# üèõÔ∏è API-Factory ‚Äî U.S. Compliance Roadmap

## üìå Overview

API-Factory is a U.S.-law aligned API marketplace. Every API module, service, and integration must map to specific U.S. regulations. This roadmap ensures developers and Copilot generate code with compliance built-in.

> Tagline: "API-Factory ‚Äî America's Compliant API Infrastructure."

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Core Compliance Baseline

- Implement FTC Privacy & Security requirements.
- Add State Data Breach Notifications (CA, NY, IL).
- Adopt NIST Cybersecurity Framework for logging, MFA, audit trails.
- Enforce Consent-first APIs via SafeNow layer.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Vertical Integrations

- Finance APIs (FWB, SafePay)
  - SEC & CFTC compliance ‚Üí signals-only mode unless ATS registered.
  - FinCEN AML/KYC integration.
  - CFPB Reg E for payments.
- Healthcare APIs (MediBridge, MedSpa)
  - HIPAA/HITECH-compliant PHI handling.
  - Breach notification automation.
  - FDA app/device alignment for wearables.
- Education APIs (EduPass, EduAI)
  - FERPA-compliant student data handling.
  - COPPA protections for under-13 users.
  - ADA accessibility outputs.
- IoT APIs (HomeSphere, SafeNow)
  - FTC IoT Security compliance.
  - State biometric privacy laws.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Enterprise & Government APIs

- MissionAPI (drones) ‚Üí FAA Part 107 compliance baked in.
- TransitFlow ‚Üí EPA emissions reporting APIs.
- AgriChain ‚Üí USDA & FDA FSMA food traceability.
- CivicWatch ‚Üí FOIA-ready audit logs + Whistleblower Protection Act standards.
- ClimateProof ‚Üí SEC ESG reporting, EPA carbon standards.

## üìä Compliance Matrix (developer reference)

| Area | Law / Policy | API Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| Core Platform | FTC Act, NIST CSF, State Laws | Consent logs, audit trails |
| Identity | REAL ID, NIST 800-63, COPPA | MFA, selective disclosure |
| Finance | SEC, CFTC, BSA, CFPB | AML/KYC, Reg E, signals-only |
| Healthcare | HIPAA, HITECH, FDA | PHI encryption, breach notice |
| Education | FERPA, ADA, COPPA | Data vaults, accessibility |
| IoT | FTC IoT, State Biometric Laws | Secure smart devices |
| Enterprise/Gov | FAA, EPA, USDA, FOIA, SEC ESG | Gov-grade compliance APIs |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Guidelines (default policy)

- All APIs must fail closed (deny if consent missing).
- Logging = immutable + time-stamped (SafeNow audit trail).
- Default crypto = AES-256 + TLS 1.3.
- Consent tokens = JWT w/ expiration + scope.
- Regulatory checks = run as pre-deployment tests.

## Minimal contract (for implementers)

- Inputs: API request, authenticated identity, consent token (JWT), requested scope.
- Outputs: resource or explicit denial, immutable audit record, consent status.
- Error modes: missing/expired consent, malformed JWT, policy violation ‚Üí deny with audit log.
- Success criteria: request honored only when consent scope present, audit record written.

## Likely edge cases

- Missing or expired consent token.
- Cross-jurisdiction requests (different state breach laws).
- High volume / DoS protection while preserving immutable logs.
- Partial data access requests (selective disclosure).

## Implementation checklist (short-term, actionable)

1. Add this roadmap doc to `docs/` ‚Äî Done (this file).
2. Create a `policy/` folder to store machine-readable policy rules (OPA/Rego) ‚Äî Recommended next step.
3. Add a SafeNow audit-trail service skeleton (immutable append-only store) in `packages/` ‚Äî Next step.
4. Add JWT consent middleware to each API service (fail-closed default) ‚Äî Next step.
5. Add CI pre-deploy checks that run regulatory tests (basic Lint + policy tests) ‚Äî Next step.
6. Create templates for verticals (finance, healthcare, education) that wire in specific controls (encryption, breach notifier) ‚Äî Backlog.

## Quick developer notes

- Prefer small, testable changes: add middleware and tests first.
- Keep regulatory logic in versioned, audited policy files (not inline code).
- Use feature flags for signals-only modes in finance integrations.
- Automate breach notifications per-state using templated workflows.

---

## Next steps (what I can do for you)

- Create `docs/US-COMPLIANCE-ROADMAP.md` (Done).
- Create `policy/` directory + example OPA rule for consent enforcement.
- Scaffold JWT consent middleware for one backend service and add tests.

If you'd like, tell me which next step to implement and I will add it.

## Completion

This file is intended as the single-source roadmap for US regulation alignment. Keep it updated as laws or internal architecture change.
