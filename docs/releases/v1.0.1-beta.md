# Beta v1.0.1 — In-House API Lineup

Release snapshot: 2025-09-08

Summary
--------
V1.0.1 focuses on launching three in-house APIs that provide monetization, standardization, and trust for the platform:

- Billing & Usage API (core revenue engine)
- Docs & SDK Generator API (standardizes SDKs/docs from OpenAPI)
- Compliance Lite API (KYC-lite + fraud scoring)

These ship as the "Must-Be In-House" features for the Beta release. Community/third-party APIs remain optional for later releases.

Why
---
Launching these delivers three business pillars: monetization (billing + API keys), stickiness (auto-generated SDKs/docs), and trust (light compliance/fraud protections).

Quick launch checklist
---------------------
- [ ] Finalize API contracts and OpenAPI specs for each in-house API
- [ ] Implement server-side endpoints + basic data store (mockable for beta)
- [ ] Wire Stripe integration for Billing (test mode only)
- [ ] Implement generator pipeline for OpenAPI → docs + SDKs (TS/Python)
- [ ] Implement KYC-lite flow + fraud scoring service (can be a composed microservice using third-party or simple heuristics)
- [ ] Add automated tests (unit + integration smoke tests) and a minimal demo in the admin web
- [ ] Prepare release notes and docs (this file)

What's included in this release (high level)
-------------------------------------------

1) Billing & Usage API
  - Tracks credits, quotas, and per-API usage.
  - Connects to Stripe to issue/revoke API keys.
  - Provides endpoints for usage reporting, balance/credits, and admin operations.

2) Docs & SDK Generator API
  - Accepts an OpenAPI spec and produces: polished docs (static site) + TypeScript + Python SDKs.
  - Provides a simple UI/CLI to trigger generation and download artifacts.

3) Compliance Lite API
  - KYC-lite (dummy identity checks + email verification)
  - Fraud risk scoring using IP/device heuristics
  - Minimal telemetry for reviewing suspicious enrollments

Next steps (recommended)
------------------------

1. Create implementation tasks (issues) for each API with the acceptance tests below.
2. Implement minimal, well-tested mockable services for the beta; defer enterprise-grade integrations to later.
3. Add example client usage (small snippets) to `/apps/admin-web` demo pages.
