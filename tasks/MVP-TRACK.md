MVP Track — API Factory

Overview

This document starts the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) track for the API Factory repository. It captures the high-level goal, scope for the MVP, acceptance criteria, milestones, and immediate next actions to get the team moving.

High-level goal

- Deliver a small, functional slice of API Factory that proves core flows and can be iterated on quickly.

MVP Scope (recommended)

- Authentication: API key creation + basic key-based auth middleware.
- Core API: Create and fetch a minimal resource (e.g., "Factory" or "Project").
- Admin UI: Minimal admin view that lists resources and API keys (optional lightweight web page).
- CLI: A simple CLI command to create a resource and call the API (optional).
- Tests: Basic unit + integration tests for the API endpoints and auth.

Out of scope (for MVP)

- Full production hardening (rate limits, multi-tenant fine-grained RBAC).
- Advanced billing or payment integrations.
- Full documentation site (we'll add targeted docs for the delivered features).

Acceptance criteria

- A repo branch exists with the MVP changes.
- End-to-end flow works: create API key -> create resource -> read resource using the key.
- Tests covering core happy path pass in CI (or locally).
- README section documenting how to run the MVP locally.

Milestones and rough timeline

1. Day 0–2: Kickoff and scaffolding
   - Create MVP branch
   - Add `tasks/MVP-TRACK.md` (this file)
   - Create high-level issues for each scoped item
2. Day 3–7: Core API + Auth
   - Implement resource model, basic endpoints, and API key auth middleware
   - Add unit tests for core logic
3. Day 8–12: Integration + CLI/UI
   - Lightweight CLI or admin web page to exercise the flow
   - Integration tests for the happy path
4. Day 13–14: Polish + Docs + CI
   - README updates, CI test job for MVP, open PR for review

Immediate next actions (what I can do now)

- Create issues for each scoped item (API, auth, tests, CLI/UI, docs).
- Create a feature branch: `feature/mvp-track` and push it.
- Scaffold a minimal README section `MVP` and add run steps.

Suggested issue list (create these in your tracker)

- MVP: Scaffolding & branch
- MVP: API resource model + endpoints
- MVP: API key auth middleware
- MVP: Unit tests for core logic
- MVP: Integration tests (E2E happy path)
- MVP: Minimal admin UI / CLI
- MVP: README + local run instructions

How to create a branch and open a PR (optional)

# Create branch and push
git checkout -b feature/mvp-track
git add tasks/MVP-TRACK.md
git commit -m "chore: add MVP track plan"
git push -u origin feature/mvp-track

# Open a PR (with GitHub CLI installed)
gh pr create --title "chore(mvp): start MVP track" --body "Adds MVP tracking doc and initial plan"

Notes & assumptions

- I assumed the team prefers a small, focused MVP delivering an end-to-end happy path. If you want a different scope, tell me and I will update the track.
- I did not create GitHub issues or open a branch automatically—tell me if you want me to create issues or push a branch and I will run the commands.

Status

- tasks/MVP-TRACK.md created in repo.

Next (if you want)

- I can create the branch and push it, create the GitHub issues, or scaffold the minimal README and CI job — tell me which to do next.
