# AUTOPILOT GUARDRAILS ‚Äî READ BEFORE EDITING/DEPLOYING
**WARNING:** This file is auto-generated by an internal tool. DO NOT use automated workflows to perform privileged or destructive actions without explicit human review.
- Do NOT include secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- Do NOT auto-merge PRs created by automation; require at least one human reviewer.
- If integrating external services (LLMs, third-party APIs), ensure approved tokens, rate-limits, and audit logs are configured.
- Label automation PRs clearly (e.g., `automation`) and assign an owner for review.

 # API-Factory ‚Äî MVP Next Steps (Paste-Ready for GitHub Copilot)

 _Target: ship an end-to-end, billable MVP with health/ping/echo + guarded Actions + Stripe + usage + CI._

 ---

 ## 0) Definition of MVP (Scope Lock)
 - [ ] Public API: `/_api/healthz`, `/api/v1/hello/ping`, `/api/v1/hello/echo`
 - [ ] Guarded Actions: `POST /api/v1/actions` (Bearer/x-api-key, rate-limited)
 - [ ] Monetization (Stripe): plan ‚Üí key lifecycle (issue/suspend/revoke) via webhooks
 - [ ] Usage: per-key counters (requests, status), Prometheus scrape + simple Admin charts
 - [ ] CI/CD: lint + typecheck + test + build on PR
 - [ ] Admin Web: Health, Ping, Actions console, Rate badge, Metrics (parsed text), Key status

 ---

 ## 1) CI/CD (close the red gap first)
 - [ ] Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with matrix:
       - workspaces: `apps/api-cli`, `apps/admin-web`, `packages/core`
       - steps: `pnpm install`, `pnpm -r lint`, `pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm -r test --if-present`, `pnpm -r build`
 - [ ] Require checks on `main` branch (GitHub settings)

 **Copilot prompt tip:** ‚ÄúCreate a GitHub Actions workflow `ci.yml` for a pnpm monorepo (apps/*, packages/*) running lint, typecheck, test, build.‚Äù

 ---

 ## 2) Stripe Monetization (minimal but real)
 - [ ] Server: Stripe webhook endpoint `/api/stripe/webhook` (events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `invoice.payment_failed`)
 - [ ] Map plan ‚Üí quota & rate caps; write key to store (Supabase or KV)
 - [ ] Admin Web: show billing status + current quota, expose ‚ÄúTest Webhook‚Äù button in dev

Roadmap guide
=============

Place roadmap notes, proposals, and long-term plans in this folder. Use the issue template `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/roadmap-suggestion.md` to collect suggestions from contributors.

Recommended files:
- `90-day.md` ‚Äî short-term milestones
- `strategy.md` ‚Äî long-term vision

Use `tools/roadmap-copilot/generate_roadmap.cjs` to aggregate these documents into a proposal.

CI / Automation
---------------
This repository includes a workflow `.github/workflows/roadmap-copilot.yml` that runs the generator on-demand or weekly and opens a pull request with the updated `ROADMAP_PROPOSAL.md` for review.

Review guidance:
- Inspect the generated `tools/roadmap-copilot/output/ROADMAP_PROPOSAL.md` in the PR.
- Update or split suggested items into milestone-backed issues before merging.
- Label and assign owners as appropriate.

Quick test
----------
Run the included test to verify the generator produces the expected header:

	./tools/roadmap-copilot/test.sh

Guardrails
----------
Auto-generated proposals include an `AUTOPILOT GUARDRAILS` block at the top. Before merging automation PRs:

- [ ] Confirm all services are running and accessible.

## 5. Smoke Test the Beta
- [ ] Manually test all major flows (login, API publish, billing, marketplace, etc.).
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs or misconfigurations.

# Marketing Automation & Content Generation ‚Äî 2025-09-07

Summary
- Adds Marketing Workspace to Admin for campaign content generation and automation.
- Uses an LLM (OpenAI by default) to generate email copy, social posts, subject lines, and campaign assets.
- Generated content is committed to a new branch and a PR is opened (labels: marketing, marketing-autogen) for review ‚Äî merges remain gated by repo protections (guardrails preserved).
- Admin UI can dispatch generation (via workflow_dispatch) or call the admin-api which may create PRs directly.
- A GitHub workflow is included to run marketing generation in CI or by schedule.

Security & Secrets
- GITHUB_TOKEN (Actions) is available automatically ‚Äî for the workflow, ensure the default token has write permissions for contents/pulls or use a PAT secret with appropriate scopes.
- OPENAI_API_KEY (or other LLM provider API key)
- Optional: SENDGRID_API_KEY, TWITTER_BEARER, LINKEDIN_TOKEN, etc for channel posting (not auto-posting in this initial scaffold ‚Äî posts should remain manual or gated)
- Store tokens in environment or GitHub Secrets. Admin API must be deployed behind admin authentication.

Architecture
- packages/admin: Marketing UI page to create campaigns, view campaign files, generate content, open marketing PRs.
- packages/admin-api: endpoints:
  - GET /api/marketing/campaigns ‚Äî list existing campaign folders from marketing/campaigns/
  - POST /api/marketing/generate ‚Äî generate content from LLM (returns result, does not commit)
  - POST /api/marketing/create-pr ‚Äî create branch, add generated content file, open PR
- .github/workflows/marketing-autogen.yml ‚Äî dispatchable workflow that runs a generation script and opens PR using repo secrets (useful for scheduled campaigns).

Next steps & recommendations
1. Add admin auth + rate-limiting to admin-api before exposing to the internet.
2. Keep PR creation gated ‚Äî do not auto-merge.
3. Add provider adapters for other LLMs or marketing channels.
4. Implement analytics & tracking for campaign performance.

# Release plan ‚Äî v1.0.0-beta

**Generated:** 2025-09-08

Summary
- Beta snapshot shows core modules ready: SDK Templates, Marketplace, Billing, Tiers, Compliance, Admin UI.
- Several features scaffolded (web3 billing, marketplace, plugins, SDK voting); marketing automation scaffold exists but requires gated PR/workflow permissions.

Top priorities
- Prepare production secrets & env (DevOps) ‚Äî High
  - Provision secrets in a secret manager and reference them from deploy configs.
- Harden `admin-api` (Backend) ‚Äî High
  - Add auth, rate-limiting, and integration tests before public exposure.
- Update deployment configs & deploy to beta/staging (DevOps/Eng) ‚Äî High
  - Review Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, Vercel configs; set ports, resource limits, domains.
- Smoke test major flows (QA/Fullstack) ‚Äî High
  - Login, API publish, billing flow, marketplace purchase/listing, plugin onboarding.

Quick checklist (for the next 72 hours)
- [ ] Add production secrets to secret manager and wire `.env.production` (DevOps).
- [ ] Add basic admin-api auth + rate-limiting and run integration tests (Backend).
- [ ] Review & update Docker/Vercel deployment configs (DevOps).
- [ ] Deploy to beta/staging and validate services are reachable (DevOps/Eng).
- [ ] Run smoke tests and file critical bug tickets (QA).
- [ ] Tag release `v1.0.0-beta` after smoke test sign-off (Release lead).
- [ ] Publish beta snapshot and onboarding notes to `/docs/roadmap/` (Docs/PM).

Smoke test checklist (minimal)
- Auth: create account, sign in, sign out

# Release Gate (RELEASES)

Purpose
- The `RELEASES/LOCK` file controls which release is next and whether the gate is locked. After a successful release, run the unlock script to advance to the next patch release and unlock the gate.

Workflow
1. Release branch is cut and release performed for the version listed in `RELEASES/LOCK` under `next`.
2. After successful production rollout and verification, run `scripts/unlock_next_release.sh <released-version>`.
3. The script will append an entry to `RELEASES/HISTORY.md` and update `RELEASES/LOCK` to the next patch (e.g., v1.0.1) and set `locked: false`.

See `scripts/unlock_next_release.sh` for details.
